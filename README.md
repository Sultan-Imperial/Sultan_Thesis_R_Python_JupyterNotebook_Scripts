## 🌟 Overview

This repository contains the complete set of **R Markdown files**, **Python scripts**, **Jupyter Notebooks**, **Bash utilities**, and **HTML reports** used in the computational analysis for my PhD thesis.

My research focuses on discovering **non-invasive circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) biomarkers** to improve the **detection**, **monitoring**, and **prognosis** of **hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)**.  
The overarching aim of this thesis is to help patients with HCC live better and longer lives by harnessing the power of **liquid biopsy** and **real-time tumour genomics**.

## 🧬 Research Goals

- Analyse cfDNA using **fragmentomics**, **copy-number alterations**, and **mutation profiling**.  
- Estimate tumour burden using **ichorCNA** and **DELFI-inspired fragmentation metrics**.  
- Develop **prognostic markers** in TACE-, TKI-, and ICI-treated cohorts.  
- Build **diagnostic models** to classify Healthy, CLD, and HCC individuals.  
- Investigate **mitochondrial cfDNA**, end-motif patterns, and chromosomal instability.  
- Produce reproducible and transparent workflows for translational biomarker discovery.
